# Shell

Contains a simple Unix Shell replica. Only core functions are present so far.

There is a bug with arguments[] not saving it's contents.

Possible fixes:
- Use another way to parse text. (Making your own Linux shell guide)
- Return a new arguments[] from the function.
- If all else fails, do parsing in the main function. This should work in every case.
